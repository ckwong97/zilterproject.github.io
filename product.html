        <a href="https://www.toptenreviews.com/home/vacuum-carpet-cleaning/best-upright-vacuum-cleaners/bissell-cleanview-onepass-review/" target="_blank"><img src="images/r1.svg" width="300px"></a>
        <p>"The Bissell CleanView One Pass is an upright vacuum cleaner that does a decent job of cleaning floors, but it’s bulky and hard to maneuver around corners and tight spaces. This is a very affordable vacuum that is good at vacuuming pet hair and has suction control for vacuuming various types of surfaces. It’s a good tool for pet owners but has some weaknesses. The performance of this vacuum was hurt by the lack of maneuverability. It only moves back and forth and is extremely clunky around corners. You can vacuum with the handle close to the ground, however, which allowed us to push the vacuum far under a console, but other tight areas were more challenging.</p>
        <p>PROS / This vacuum has suction control so it can adjust for different surfaces.</p>
        <p>CONS / It is bulky and awkward around corners.</p>
        <p>VERDICT / The Bissell CleanView is an affordable vacuum cleaner with nice tools to help make up for its limited maneuverability and merely average suction."</p>

        <p>"All things considered, my opinion is that this is a solid vacuum. Given the VGM, buying this product will most likely turn out to be a good investment. If you own an average home, with 4-5 bedrooms and just a few bare floor areas, than this vacuum is perfect for you.
  Most inexpensive vacuum cleaners provide less suction power, bigger noise pumps, weight more and are more difficult to use. You simply can’t expect from a product under $100 to have more than 2 years of warranty. </p>
  <p>Simply put, BISSELL CleanView Upright Vacuum with OnePass is a bargain.
  Overall, this is a top 5 in the list of vacuum cleaners under $150. I definitely recommend this product, you’ll have your home clean and some cash left in your pocket."</p>

        <p>The affordable Bissell CleanView, our top budget pick, did a good job removing embedded dirt in our test carpet, and boasted the highest maximum air power (or suction) of any model in our test when we measured it at the end of the hose, where the dusting and crevice tools are attached. The Bissell was quiet in our test, but consumer testers complained that, at 15 pounds, it was a little too heavy to comfortably carry up and down the stairs compared to other lightweight cleaners in our test.</p>
        <p>Pros</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Good air performance at the end of the hose</li>
          <li>Good at removing embedded dirt and pet hair from carpet</li>
          <li>Quiet while vacuuming</li>
          <li>Easy to empty dust cup without making a mess</li>
          <li>Helpful customer service line</li>
          <li>Inexpensive</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cons</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Scattered some of the dirt when cleaning bare floors</li>
          <li>Tipped over when the hose was extended too far from the vacuum</li>
        </ul>
